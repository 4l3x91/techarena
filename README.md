This app was done during TechArena's hackathon 11-12 of May, we spent 23 hours on this project and it has a frontend built with react+ts and bootstrap, a backend on c# with ef & auth and a SQLite db.

In Trainder you can list your interests/hobbies, and match with people who have similar hobbies. If you want to learn how to climb, and don't want to start off on your own, find someone to go with.

This app is designed to have people meet and get some exercise, as well as dampen mental illness.
